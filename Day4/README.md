# Day 4

## Ansible Automation Platform - Control Node Overview
<pre>
- The system that runs the automation playbooks.
- It has Ansible Core installed.
- It connects to managed nodes (hosts) via SSH or other protocols (e.g., WinRM).
- It uses Execution Environments (containers) to run automation jobs.
- Starting from AAP 2.x, the Automation Controller (formerly known as Tower) delegates 
    execution to Execution Nodes, but it is still considered a Control Node 
    because it manages the automation workflows.  
- Receives API/UI requests
- Queues and schedules automation jobs
- Delegates execution to Execution Nodes
- Maintains inventory, projects, credentials, job templates
- Collects job results and logs.
- Communicates with the database and Redis (for async tasks)

## Ansible Automation Platform - Execution Node Overview
<pre>
- Execution Nodes are specialized nodes designed only to run automation jobs 
- They provide scalable and isolated execution environments
- especially useful in large or distributed deployments  
- Executes automation jobs delegated from the Control Node (Automation Controller).
- Runs jobs in containerized Execution Environments (EEs).
- Does not manage inventory, credentials, or job templatesâ€”those reside on the Control Node
- Is designed to scale out automation horizontally
